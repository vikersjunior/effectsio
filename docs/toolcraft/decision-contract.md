# Decision Contract

Use this before writing a schema, spec, or implementation plan. It separates hard runtime rules from product decisions.

## Rule Levels

| Level | Meaning | Required Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invariant | Cannot be violated | Follow it; tests should fail if broken |
| Default | Normal choice | Use it unless the spec proves a reason not to |
| Heuristic | Product-dependent decision | Decide from product behavior and test the choice |
| Escape hatch | Allowed exception | Explain why and add stronger coverage |
| Recommendation | Style guidance | Follow unless product behavior requires otherwise |

## Area Guide

| Area | Decision Type | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime shell | Invariant | Use `defineToolcraft` and `ToolcraftAppComposition`; the signed host renders `ToolcraftApp` |
| Canvas | Mixed | No app UI in `canvasContent`; handles are product-dependent |
| Panels | Mixed | Panel mechanics are hard; panel presence is product-dependent |
| Layers | Heuristic, then invariant | Enable only for real layer behavior; fully test when enabled |
| Timeline | Heuristic, then invariant | Choose from Animation Intent Inventory and transport behavior |
| Controls | Mixed | Bind every visible control, choose one evidence-backed surface per operation, and make artifact UI match required export intent |
| Renderer | Default plus invariant | Choose technique from fidelity/workload and declare spatial view interaction before renderer code |
| Reference analysis | Invariant | Study video references as frame-to-frame behavior before implementation |
| Reference clone | Invariant | Preserve reference behavior unless redesign is explicit |
| Acceptance | Invariant | Prove product observables, not only runtime mutation |
| Performance | Mixed | Workload controls need enforced envelope boundaries; derived paths receive central profiles; animated previews yield to viewport interactions |
| Persistence | Default, then invariant | State persistence must be explicit; localStorage apps must prove reload restoration |
| Workflow | Invariant | Follow signed local workflow, use available skills, and run browser verification |

The runtime shell invariant means product code exports the typed composition and does not edit the signed route. The host renders `ToolcraftApp`; product modules must not hand-compose `ToolcraftRoot`, `CanvasShell`, `ControlsPanel`, `TimelinePanel`, `LayersPanel`, or `ToolbarPanel`. App-specific source also must not render built-in control components directly; schema controls and `controlRenderers` are the allowed control extension points.

## Rule Catalog

This catalog mirrors `TOOLCRAFT_DECISION_CONTRACT`. If runtime adds or renames a rule id, this page and `AGENTS.md` must list the same id.

`output-export-required` keeps artifact intent and implementation in exact correspondence. Product-mode readiness records `productReadiness.exportIntent`; schema actions, settings sections, and artifact acceptance expose exactly the enabled image/video capabilities. The authoritative decision sequence and evidence requirements live in `core/setup-export.md`.

## Enforcement

Hard rules belong in validators and browser gates, not only prose. Heuristics need decision criteria and tests for the chosen behavior.

| Enforcement | Use It For |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime behavior | Mechanics owned by the shared runtime |
| Schema normalization | Repeated layout and density decisions |
| Acceptance validator | Product behavior and control coverage |
| Performance validator | Workload envelopes, canonical paths, and central profiles |
| Browser helper | Real UI interaction and visual breakage |
| CLI integrity check | Generated-app source boundaries |
| Local docs and `AGENTS.md` | Decision criteria and workflow instructions |
